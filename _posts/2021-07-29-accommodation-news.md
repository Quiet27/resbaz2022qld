### Accommodation options for ResBazQld

We have negotiated a deal with [St Leo's College](https://www.stleos.uq.edu.au/) at UQ to provide overnight stays for $90 per person. This would be a student-style accommodation room with a shared bathroom. The cost includes breakfast and dinner. Lunch will be provided at ResBazQld.

St Leo's is approximately five minutes' walk from the ResBazQld UQ venue. This could be a great option for people travelling from Toowoomba, Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast and other places.

We will shortly be posting a link to a form to express interest.
