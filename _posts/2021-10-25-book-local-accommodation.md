## Want to stay on campus for ResBaz Qld?

If you are travelling to Brisbane to attend ResBaz Qld, you can book accommodation at St Leo's College at UQ - this residential college is 5 minutes' walk from the ResBaz Qld venue.

Accommodation in a single room with shared bathroom starts at $80 per night, and includes breakfast. There are also other more private options (i.e. your own bathroom) at a higher cost.
