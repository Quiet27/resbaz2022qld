  title: "Learn how to share your code and results with end users: Shiny app fundamentals in R"
  description: "Ever wanted to share your R code with industry partners or end users who weren’t familiar with the language? Or wished that you could build an interactive app that only required non-technical stakeholders to click a few buttons? 

  

Shiny is a popular R package that allows you to build highly interactive web applications—without needing any other programming languages. Using Shiny you can share your analyses as dashboards and visualisations and create interactive platforms for anybody to use the tools you create (see examples here https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/). 

  

This is a workshop aimed at anyone with a working knowledge of R who is interested in better communicating their results with non-technical stakeholders. In the first part of this workshop, you will be introduced to the basic syntax and principles of R Shiny. Then we will develop an app that allows users to upload data, run analyses, and display the results in a figure and/or a map."
