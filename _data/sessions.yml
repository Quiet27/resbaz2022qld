  title: "Key Story - Exploring Australian GLAM data"
  description: "More and more institutions in the GLAM sector (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) are sharing their collection data online, but what is it, and how do you use it? In this talk, I'll survey the types of data available – including metadata, images, OCRd text, and transcriptions – and explore possible research topics. Using tools and examples from the GLAM Workbench, I’ll show how GLAM data can be harvested, aggregated, analysed, and visualised. What can GLAM data tell us about Australian history, society, and culture?"

  description: "This workshop will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks, a digital tool that has exploded in popularity in recent years for those working with data. You will learn what they are, what they do and why you might like to use them. It is an introductory set of lessons for those who are brand new, have little or no knowledge of coding and computational methods in research. By the end of the workshop you will have a good understanding of what Notebooks can do, how to open one up, perform some basic tasks and save it for later. If you are really into it, you will also be able to continue to experiment after the workshop by using other people’s notebooks as springboards for your own adventures! This workshop is targeted at those who are absolute beginners or ‘tech-curious’. It includes a hands-on component, using basic programming commands, but requires no previous knowledge of programming."

A data management plan (DMP) is a document that describes what research data will be collected - how it will be organised, documented, stored; along with publication and preservation plans. If you want to create a DMP but do not know where to start or what to include, come along to this workshop where we go through the various aspects of the University's DMP, offer best practice examples and section-by-section advice for creating your initial DMP.<br /><br />
  Session is particularly suited to provisional year doctoral candidates or researchers in the early stages of their research project."

  title: "Tidy data and introduction to OpenRefine (Rm:G30)"
  description: "This is a 'Bring your own device' session. Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too!<br /><br /> 

  Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research workflow. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent. OpenRefine is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these edits by hand."

  description: "This is a 'Bring your own laptop' session.<br /><br /> 
  There are research computing platforms running the linux operating system where no gui interface is available, and it is imperative to know how to navigate filesystems and run programs from the command-line (the shell). From the command-line you can then automate your work-processes and work much more efficiently.<br /><br /> 
  This introduction to the bash shell will cover 1) basic navigation,  2)  customizing the shell with environment variables, and 3) running small automation scripts <br /><br /> 

  Those whose laptop can boot into linux or MacOS have a bash shell already available to them. Windows users without linux should follow the <a href=\"https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\">instructions</a> so that they can boot into ubuntu from a usb stick at the beginning of the session to have access to the bash shell. Alternatively, if you are running Windows10, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10\">install</a> the Windows Subsystem for Linux."
