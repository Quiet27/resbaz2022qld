  title: "Key Story - Exploring Australian GLAM data"
  description: "More and more institutions in the GLAM sector (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) are sharing their collection data online, but what is it, and how do you use it? In this talk, I'll survey the types of data available – including metadata, images, OCRd text, and transcriptions – and explore possible research topics. Using tools and examples from the GLAM Workbench, I’ll show how GLAM data can be harvested, aggregated, analysed, and visualised. What can GLAM data tell us about Australian history, society, and culture?"

  description: "Soils 4 Science is a citizen science project based at UQ's IMB that is dedicated to finding new antibiotics needed in the fight against the scourge of drug-resistant infections, better known as superbugs. More than half of all antibiotics available worldwide have been developed from microbes found in soil and nature, and Queensland is one of the most biodiverse environments in the world, spanning beaches, rainforests, wetlands and deserts. This vast, untapped landscape is ripe for the discovery of microbes that could be developed into new antibiotics, anti-fungals and other medicines."

  subtype: workshop
  description: "This course will introduce software containers for reproducible data analysis. We will first introduce what containers are (you might have heard of Docker or Singularity already?). Then we will show examples from the neuroimaging domain how such containers can be built and used on different operating systems and high-performance computing environments. We will close with showing our open-source project `neurodesk` which combines all these technologies in a user-friendly way and makes reproducible neuroimaging accessible for a wide audience. Some command line and linux experience is of advantage, but we will cover everything that's needed.Bring a laptop with Docker installed."

  title: "Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks"
  description: "This workshop will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks, a digital tool that has exploded in popularity in recent years for those working with data. You will learn what they are, what they do and why you might like to use them. It is an introductory set of lessons for those who are brand new, have little or no knowledge of coding and computational methods in research. By the end of the workshop you will have a good understanding of what Notebooks can do, how to open one up, perform some basic tasks and save it for later. If you are really into it, you will also be able to continue to experiment after the workshop by using other people’s notebooks as springboards for your own adventures! This workshop is targeted at those who are absolute beginners or ‘tech-curious’. It includes a hands-on component, using basic programming commands, but requires no previous knowledge of programming."

  title: "What is the CVL?  An introduction to the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) for processing large imaging and characterisation data sets using GPU processing on HPC"
  description: "The rate, quantity and quality of imaging science data acquisition is increasing exponentially.  Researchers need defined, reliable and rapid pathways that they can use to process these data.  The ACCS (Australian Characterisation Commons at Scale) Project offers solutions to this critical need.  The flagship capability of the ACCS Project is the CVL (Characterisation Virtual Laboratory) (www.cvl.org.au).  The CVL offers a unique virtual space where researchers can access HPC capabilities and analyse their datasets using graphical interfaces for dozens of specialist LINUX packages.  CVL is available to all Australian researchers working in imaging and characterisation sciences using their AAF login.  Via the Strudel2 deployment over a web interface, researchers can access multiple deployments of CVL across Australia, depending on their specific tool needs and/or institutional affiliation.  The CVL enables researchers to easily access HPC setups from their own PCs over the internet for processing large volumes of imaging data on remote systems.  With 3 preset virtual desktop configurations, researchers can opt for basic, intermediate or heavy compute setups, enabling rapid analysis of terabyte-sized datasets.  CVL comes preinstalled with dozens of imaging tools, and through the ACCS, has a team ready to install new packages in response to the changing needs of the community.  The ACCS project aims to show researchers how they acquire data, move it into the CVL, and then export it back to their collections, completing a fully integrated workflow.  In this way, CVL and ACCS bring data full circle from acquisition to final FAIR deposition."

This will be a hands-on session and I will be stepping you through the pathway to establish your account and integrate your data collection.  Accounts to CVL are provisioned manually, so there will be some lag-time between applying for an account and being able to use the CVL.  I will run a follow-up session to show you how to work within the CVL environment."

I will show you how images acquired from instruments can be ingested directly into collections with newly emerging workflows (like Pitschi).  Your data collections will then available within the CVL, ready for analysis.  For those not yet connected with Pitschi, tools like FileZilla for sFTP or Globus can be used to transfer data collections.  We will work through how analysed and annotated data can be exported back to collections, ready for repository storage."
