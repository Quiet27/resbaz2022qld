  description: "More and more institutions in the GLAM sector (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) are sharing their collection data online, but what is it, and how do you use it? In this talk, I'll survey the types of data available – including metadata, images, OCRd text, and transcriptions – and explore possible research topics. Using tools and examples from the GLAM Workbench, I’ll show how GLAM data can be harvested, aggregated, analysed, and visualised. What can GLAM data tell us about Australian history, society, and culture?"

  title: "Dr Zeinab Khalil: Key Story - Soils 4 Science"
  description: "Soils 4 Science is a citizen science project based at UQ's IMB that is dedicated to finding new antibiotics needed in the fight against the scourge of drug-resistant infections, better known as superbugs. Microbe-inspired products are the source of >50% of all antibiotics in use today. Healthcare systems are increasingly confronted by multi-drug resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that are resistant to most, even all, existing antibiotics. Illustrative of the risk posed by infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic infected >120 million people leading to ~2.7M deaths worldwide. Our ability to deploy new approaches to vaccine development, including mRNA platform technology, enabled a swift response to this healthcare crisis. Similar investment in antibiotic preparedness is essential if we are to be ready for an even bigger infectious disease tsunami in the years ahead. Confronted by the loss of existing antibiotic treatments, and rising incidences of morbidity and mortality, the case for the identification of new antibiotics is clearly paramount to the current national and global healthcare priorities. Therefore, we established the FIRST Soils for Science Citizen Science Australian Program, including equipments, APP & website, that gave the general public a unique opportunity to work with scientists to discover new antibiotics from soil bacteria. This program engaged the public with the global issue of antimicrobial resistance through a practical soil-based activity, to address the challenges associated with the discovery of novel antibiotics."

In this presentation user-friendly Jupyter Notebooks in Python to perform topic modeling will be introduced and shared.

  description: "An introduction to the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) for processing large imaging and characterisation data sets using GPU processing on HPC. The rate, quantity and quality of imaging science data acquisition is increasing exponentially.  Researchers need defined, reliable and rapid pathways that they can use to process these data.  The ACCS (Australian Characterisation Commons at Scale) Project offers solutions to this critical need.  The flagship capability of the ACCS Project is the CVL (Characterisation Virtual Laboratory) (www.cvl.org.au).  The CVL offers a unique virtual space where researchers can access HPC capabilities and analyse their datasets using graphical interfaces for dozens of specialist LINUX packages.  CVL is available to all Australian researchers working in imaging and characterisation sciences using their AAF login.  Via the Strudel2 deployment over a web interface, researchers can access multiple deployments of CVL across Australia, depending on their specific tool needs and/or institutional affiliation.  The CVL enables researchers to easily access HPC setups from their own PCs over the internet for processing large volumes of imaging data on remote systems.  With 3 preset virtual desktop configurations, researchers can opt for basic, intermediate or heavy compute setups, enabling rapid analysis of terabyte-sized datasets.  CVL comes preinstalled with dozens of imaging tools, and through the ACCS, has a team ready to install new packages in response to the changing needs of the community.  The ACCS project aims to show researchers how they acquire data, move it into the CVL, and then export it back to their collections, completing a fully integrated workflow.  In this way, CVL and ACCS bring data full circle from acquisition to final FAIR deposition."

  title: "Research Software Visible, Citable and Sustained: the ARDC Software Program (talk)"
  description: "Across science disciplines, software code is being written by scientists and deemed critical to research conclusions. This is evidenced by an increasing number of papers reporting the use of customised software code to process and analyse data. Although data and code sharing policy exists, publishing the details of bespoke software is not yet a general practice. Accessibility mechanisms for provision of the source code as part of a publication or pre-print are technically a solved problem. For example, we have free access to version control systems, persistent identifiers, archiving tools, licenses and dedicated software repositories. Policy at various levels either recommend or mandate software availability statements. These policies exist in support of validating techniques and results, computational replicability and reproducibility, and the increased likelihood for research peers to use and build on methods. The ARDC is proposing a strategy for culture change, with the greater aim of improving recognition of research software as a first-class research output. To attain this goal we need to coordinate activities with research software authors to See, Shape and Sustain research software. Our target audience are PhDs and EMCRs investing the most of their time writing, testing and maintaining research software. We aim to increase the visibility of research software projects for broadest use and reuse. Boost incentives such as crediting authors for their research efforts and for supporting computational reproducibility. We envision the impact of these activities will encourage more researchers to improve the quality of their code and promote research excellence."

  title: "Run a Community of Practice Blog with Git and R (workshop)"
  description: "Grassroots communities of practice are a great way to build communities and skill share – creating an online presence and repository for knowledge, tutorials, and code can be a useful tool. We will introduce a workflow using Git and R to run a community of practice blog by forking a GitHub repository, creating a blogpost in R, and pushing the post back to GitHub. This workshop will feature the UQ Geospatial Analysis Community Group and use their new community of practice R blog as an example. Basic understanding of Git + GitHub and R + RStudio is helpful but the workshop will be aimed at beginners with no prior knowledge."

  title: "One Health Data Management System with Data Analytics"
  description: "Establishing the One Health management system for human, animal and environment is significant in the current pandemic situation. High-performance cloud computing and Big Data Analytics can be used in gathering, processing, and analysing human and animal disease data. The talk aims at the available digital research platform to engineer the one health system. Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) offers national data set for Health Studies Australian National Data Asset (HeSANDA) at ARDC. Similarly creating another National Data Asset for One Health systems would have many benefits for the research, Veterinary Sciences, Australian Cancer Research, pharmaceutical and Drug Discovery fields. Further, ARDC's Nectar Cloud would host the data analytical platform for the predictive analysis of the data. The recent advancements in Machine learning, Natural Language Processing, Text Analytics and Artificial Intelligence can be used in filling the gaps between biological sciences and information technology."
