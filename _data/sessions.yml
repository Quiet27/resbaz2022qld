  title: "Learn how to share your code and results with end users: Shiny app fundamentals in R"
  description: "Ever wanted to share your R code with industry partners or end users who weren’t familiar with the language? Or wished that you could build an interactive app that only required non-technical stakeholders to click a few buttons? <br><br> Shiny is a popular R package that allows you to build highly interactive web applications—without needing any other programming languages. Using Shiny you can share your analyses as dashboards and visualisations and create interactive platforms for anybody to use the tools you create (see examples here https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/). <br><br>This is a workshop aimed at anyone with a working knowledge of R who is interested in better communicating their results with non-technical stakeholders. In the first part of this workshop, you will be introduced to the basic syntax and principles of R Shiny. Then we will develop an app that allows users to upload data, run analyses, and display the results in a figure and/or a map."

  title: "Introduction to R with Ecology data "
  description: "EcoCommons is building the platform of choice to analyse and model ecological and environmental problems while also increasing digital literacy of researchers and students. This workshop will focus on improving your computational skills by showing you how the statistical program R can be used for data analysis and visualisation in Ecology.  <br><br>The course starts with some basic information about the R syntax, the RStudio interface, and moves through how to import CSV files. We will also show you the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors and how to add/remove rows and columns. By the end of the workshop participants will have an overview of how to run their R code in the EcoCommons cloud environment and how to use the R package {tidyverse} to manipulate and visualise their data. In particular, we will demonstrate how to use the functions ‘select’ and ‘filter’ to manipulate your data and how to use the ‘pipe operator’ for more complex data manipulation in combination with ‘summarise’, ‘group_by’ and ‘count’ for quick summary statistics. At the end, we will show you how to visualise your data using different plots in the R package {ggplot2}. <br><br>This workshop is suitable for early career researchers, undergraduates and ecologists who have a keen interest to learn how to code in R while harnessing the power of cloud computing to solve environmental challenges. This course is very suitable for researchers, students and practitioners who have no or little R experience and coding skills and have the desire to learn how to use code within the cloud-computing resources of EcoCommons. It is also well suited for people who would like to refresh their coding skills in R. <br><br>This workshop is based on the Carperntries course: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/  <br><br>This workshop is brought to you by EcoCommons Australia. EcoCommons is a partnership of nine organisations including the NCRIS-funded Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), CEBRA at the University of Melbourne, CSIRO’s Land and Water unit, Griffith University, Macquarie University, QCIF, TERN, and the University of NSW. It also involves investment from the Queensland Government’s Research Infrastructure Co-investment Fund (RICF). <br><br><br>No prior knowledge needed <br><br>It is essential that you install and test R and RStudio well before the workshop. <br><br>Please carefully follow the instructions on https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html to download, install and configure R and RStudio on your computer. If you already have R installed, please make sure it is version 4.0.0 or higher, or update it otherwise."

  title: "Introduction to FIJI (ImageJ)"
  description: "This workshop provides a basic foundation to the open source image analysis program, FIJJ (FIJI Is Just ImageJ). It is intended for people who have never used the program before, or require a re-fresher on how to open images, merge channels, perform projections etc. <br><br>  <br><br>FIJI is an open source image analysis program which builds upon ImageJ as it comes 'batteries included' meaning extra plugins and libraries are included by default for an easy installation. The software works on Windows, Mac & Linux and can be run headless on HPC. <br><br>  <br><br>Topics Covered <br><br>The intention of this workshop is to introduce new users to the program and covers the basic concepts around opening, saving and ethical manipulations to images. <br><br>  <br>- Opening/Saving/Closing Images (.tifs and Bio-Formats compatible files) <br>- Merging channels, and dealing with multiple channel images <br>- Adjusting Brightness & Contrast and using histograms <br>- Adjusting bit-depth <br>- Adding scale to images & adding scale bars <br>- Image Stacks (Montages, Projections, Re-Slicing, Orthogonal Views) <br>- Basic Measurements (Area, Intensity, Shape descriptors, Line Scans) <br>- Creating Selections (Manual, ROI Manager) <br>- Overlays <br><br><br>No prior knowledge is required, this is considered a beginners or foundation level course. <br><br>FIJI Imaging software (Download from: fiji.sc) Workshop files and content: https://osf.io/zq32x/"
