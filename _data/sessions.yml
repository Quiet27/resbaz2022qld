  title: "Key Story - Exploring Australian GLAM data"
  description: "More and more institutions in the GLAM sector (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) are sharing their collection data online, but what is it, and how do you use it? In this talk, I'll survey the types of data available – including metadata, images, OCRd text, and transcriptions – and explore possible research topics. Using tools and examples from the GLAM Workbench, I’ll show how GLAM data can be harvested, aggregated, analysed, and visualised. What can GLAM data tell us about Australian history, society, and culture?"

  title: "Key Story - Soils 4 Science"
  description: "Soils 4 Science is a citizen science project based at UQ's IMB that is dedicated to finding new antibiotics needed in the fight against the scourge of drug-resistant infections, better known as superbugs. More than half of all antibiotics available worldwide have been developed from microbes found in soil and nature, and Queensland is one of the most biodiverse environments in the world, spanning beaches, rainforests, wetlands and deserts. This vast, untapped landscape is ripe for the discovery of microbes that could be developed into new antibiotics, anti-fungals and other medicines."

  title: "Software Containers for Reproducible (Neuro) Science"
  subtype: workshop
  description: "This course will introduce software containers for reproducible data analysis. We will first introduce what containers are (you might have heard of Docker or Singularity already?). Then we will show examples from the neuroimaging domain how such containers can be built and used on different operating systems and high-performance computing environments. We will close with showing our open-source project `neurodesk` which combines all these technologies in a user-friendly way and makes reproducible neuroimaging accessible for a wide audience. Some command line and linux experience is of advantage, but we will cover everything that's needed.Bring a laptop with Docker installed."

  title: "Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks"
  description: "This workshop will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks, a digital tool that has exploded in popularity in recent years for those working with data. You will learn what they are, what they do and why you might like to use them. It is an introductory set of lessons for those who are brand new, have little or no knowledge of coding and computational methods in research. By the end of the workshop you will have a good understanding of what Notebooks can do, how to open one up, perform some basic tasks and save it for later. If you are really into it, you will also be able to continue to experiment after the workshop by using other people’s notebooks as springboards for your own adventures! This workshop is targeted at those who are absolute beginners or ‘tech-curious’. It includes a hands-on component, using basic programming commands, but requires no previous knowledge of programming."
