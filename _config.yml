# About Block
aboutTitle: "About ResBaz Queensland"
aboutSubtitle: "Conference"
aboutText: "<p>The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy at the centre of modern research. Throughout 2022, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the world.</p>

<p>Hosted in 2022 by Griffith University, the 2022 Queensland Research Bazaar will be a three-day intensive conference where researchers will come together to up-skill in 'next generation digital research tools and skills'. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!</p>

<p>Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD candidates, research Masters students and early career researchers are especially encouraged to attend. Research technologists and research software engineers who support researchers to do their job should also come along! Sessions at this year's ResBaz will offer a brief practical introduction to a broad selection of topics and tools related to digital research practice relevant across the disciplines.</p>.

<p>ResBaz Qld is being run in accordance with our Covid safe plan. We encourage wearing a mask if you are not able to social distance. You must not attend in person if you have travelled to any declared Covid hotspot in the last 14 days, if you are subject to any quarantine or isolation restrictions, or if you have any cold or flu symptoms.</p>"
