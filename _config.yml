aboutText: "<p>The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2021, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.</p>

<p>Hosted by The University of Queensland, the 2021 Queensland Research Bazaar is a three-day intensive conference where researchers will come together to up-skill in 'next generation digital research tools and skills'. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!</p>

<p>Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students and early career researchers are especially encouraged to attend. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along! Sessions at ResBaz this year are intended to offer a brief practical introduction to a broad selection of topics and tools related to digital research practice relevant across the disciplines.</p>"
